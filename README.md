# Alfred "Hello World" experiment
 A minimal "hello world" Alfred experiment.

## Starting the experiment

You need to have Alfred installed ([Alfred on GitHub](https://github.com/ctreffe/alfred)).

 1. Download and unpack or clone the repository.

 2. Open a terminal window and switch to the experiment directory
 
 ```bash 
 cd PATH-TO-EXPERIMENT
 ```
 
 3. Run the experiment by executing the following code in a terminal window

 ```bash
 python run.py
 ```

 Your programming takes place in `script.py`, metadata like experiment author, title, etc. should be entered in `config.conf`. Generally, for normal use cases you should not change `run.py`.
